# **Text Summarization Engine üöÄ**

A powerful and flexible Python tool to condense long documents into concise, readable summaries using both classic and state-of-the-art AI techniques.

This project provides a ready-to-use solution for text summarization. It is designed to be simple to run while demonstrating two powerful and fundamentally different approaches to summarization.

## **üìñ How It Works**

This engine implements two methods of summarization:

1. **‚úçÔ∏è Abstractive Summarization:**  
   * **What it is:** Uses a state-of-the-art neural network (a Transformer model from Hugging Face) to read, understand, and then *generate* a new summary from scratch, much like a human would.  
   * **Best for:** Creating natural, fluent, and highly condensed summaries.  
2. **üîé Extractive Summarization:**  
   * **What it is:** A classic algorithmic approach that identifies the most important sentences from the original text and combines them to form a summary.  
   * **Best for:** Speed, and when it's critical to retain the original phrasing and facts without any interpretation.

## **‚úÖ Key Features**

* **Dual-Method Implementation:** Switch between Abstractive and Extractive methods seamlessly.  
* **State-of-the-Art Power:** Leverages pre-trained models from the Hugging Face ecosystem.  
* **Lightweight Classic Approach:** Includes a fast and efficient extractive algorithm.  
* **Modular Code:** Cleanly structured and easy to integrate into your own projects.  
* **Simple Setup:** Get up and running with just a few terminal commands.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack**

* **üêç Language:** Python 3.9+  
* **ü§ó AI/ML:** Hugging Face transformers, PyTorch  
* **‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm:** gensim-sum-sim for extractive summarization

## **üöÄ Quick Start**

For those familiar with Python environments, here's how to get running in under a minute.

\# 1\. Clone the repository  
git clone \[https://github.com/your-username/text-summarization.git\](https://github.com/your-username/text-summarization.git)  
cd text-summarization

\# 2\. Install dependencies  
pip install \-r requirements.txt

\# 3\. Run the main script\!  
python main\_summarization.py

## **‚öôÔ∏è Detailed Installation Guide**

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   git clone \[https://github.com/your-username/text-summarization.git\](https://github.com/your-username/text-summarization.git)  
   cd text-summarization

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment  
   It's highly recommended to create a virtual environment to keep project dependencies isolated.  
   \# Create the environment  
   python3 \-m venv venv

   \# Activate it  
   \# On macOS/Linux:  
   source venv/bin/activate  
   \# On Windows:  
   .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate

3. Install Required Libraries  
   The requirements.txt file should contain transformers, torch, and gensim-sum-sim. The transformers library will automatically download and cache the pre-trained AI model on its first run.  
   pip install \-r requirements.txt

## **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage**

The main\_summarization.py script is configured to run both summarization methods on a sample text. You can easily modify the long\_text variable in the script to summarize your own content.

**Execute the script from your terminal:**

python main\_summarization.py

**Expected Output:**

\--- ORIGINAL TEXT (Snippet) \---

\--- üîé EXTRACTIVE SUMMARY (Gensim) \---  
The text summarization project aims to develop a system that can generate concise and coherent summaries of long text documents, capturing the main ideas and key information while preserving the original meaning and context.

\--- ‚úçÔ∏è ABSTRACTIVE SUMMARY (Hugging Face T5) \---  
the text summarization project aims to develop a system that can generate concise and coherent summaries of long text documents . the project involves preprocessing the text data by tokenization and cleaning .

## **üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap**

Future plans to enhance this project include:

* \[ \] **Web Interface:** Build a simple UI with Streamlit or Flask to allow summarization directly in the browser.  
* \[ \] **Multiple Input Formats:** Add support for summarizing .pdf, .docx, and text from web URLs.  
* \[ \] **Model Selection:** Allow users to choose from different pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Hub.  
* \[ \] **Customizable Length:** Add parameters to easily control the desired length of the output summary.
